Topic : Library Information System(LIS)


Q1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

Functional Requirements(FRs):

* Basically the system will do the task of taking the record of the issue and returning the books and it can be done by students,professors or any members of the college.
* Users can request for books,extend the return date and return the books at any time before the return date.
* Library Information System members can add the new books and also manage the existing books.
* Any non-member should be free to use this system to browse/search books online.
* All the User activities will be taken care of by the system members.
* All Information about the books should be seen to the non-member so that accordingly he/she can choose the book with the correct edition.  
* When a user wants to issue the book, the system should prompt them for their username and password.The system verifies that the credentials entered are accurate, i.e. Whether the given username already exists or not, the password is accurate.
* System should provide the facility to change the password of non- member so that if user forgot his/her password then he/she can’t use the system any more so fro that reason system should give the facility to change the password or forgot password option.
* Only if the user is a member of the system should the LIS system allow the user to borrow a book or return it if it has already been borrowed. Once a librarian acknowledges a user's request to borrow a book, the user is then able to do so.
* The system should not provide the user the opportunity to borrow a book if it has already been checked out by another user and should instead inform the user that the book has already been checked out by others.
* If a user requests a list of the books they have presently borrowed, books they have previously borrowed, the date they were borrowed and returned, and other information, the system should do so for that user.
* When a new book is purchased, a system should enable the librarian to add a new record to the database or remove a record in the event that a book is taken off the shelf.
* The system should calculate the fine for the overdue books when they are returned and notify the user and librarian of the overdue books.


Non-Functional Requirements(FRs):

* Usability- Everyone should be able to understand the user interface (UI) and find the necessary information without any extra training. Depending on the needs, other languages can be offered.
* Availability- When the library is open, the System must be functional, and if it is not, it must be repaired in an hour or less. Within two seconds or fewer, the system needs to react to the queries.
* Maintainability- Adding new features and changing the programme should be as straightforward as possible, and the software should be simple to maintain. The software must also be portable in addition to this.
* Accuracy- The information that is recorded about the books and the fines that are assessed must be accurate, dependable, and consistent.
* Security – To access the system, a user must enter a username and password. Additionally, it must confirm that it functions on the LAN of the university.
* Performance - It should take the system maximum of two to three seconds to respond to a request.
* Scalability - The system must function correctly and without error when a large number of users access it.
* Reliability- System should be reliable and accessible throughout the entire time the library is open. At this specific moment, the system shouldn't experience any failure.



Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.


Scope :

* People in our culture who are disabled and unable to communicate exist. They lack hearing. A deaf individual needs assistance from someone else to live independently. They can communicate with the outside world with the aid of this programme.

Features:

* Additionally, customers should be able to choose whether they want their output to be in the form of a tone, a vibration, or both from the system.
* The system should prompt users to choose the resulting tone, such as a bell tone or car horns, when they desire immediate warnings.
* It should be possible to modify and remove voice data, voice types, etc. in the system.
* In an emergency or other urgent scenario, users can turn on the flash light.
* The time interval between two adjacent notifications should be configurable by users.
* There should be a range of speech requirements for voice recognition in the system.
* The user must decide if the information (alert) should be sent through phone, email, or both.


Non- Functional Requirements(FRs):

* The system should be simple to use and understand. To ensure that all new users utilize the system correctly, it can offer a help page.
* Performance should be better so that user experience can be improved.
* Any voice on the list should be recognised by the system without issue.
* All smartphones with Android software should be able to operate the system.
* The system should respond quickly, without any errors, and its performance shouldn't degrade with time or use.
* In the event of a mistake or system failure, the administrator and user should be notified.
* The system should permit the addition of new voices without altering existing ones.
* Any query should respond quickly to guarantee that the needs are met.
* The user interface (UI) must be appealing to the eye and feature many expressive visuals.
